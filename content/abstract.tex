\begin{abstract}
In the course of this paper we will develop a domain specific language (DSL) for expressing usage management policies and associating those policies with managed artifacts.  We begin by framing a use model for the language, including generalized use cases, a loose ontology, an general supported lifecycle, and specific extension requirements.  We then develop the language from that model, demonstrating key syntactic elements and highlighting the technology behind the language while tracing features back to the initial model.  We also compare and contrast this DSL with others developed for rights management (e.g. Ponder).  We then demonstrate how the DSL supports common usage management and DRM-centric environments, including creative commons, the extensible rights markup language (XRML), and the open digital rights language (ODRL).
